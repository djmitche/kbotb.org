      <h3>Reggie Instructions</h3>

      <p>
      This year the Knickerbocker is using Reggie to handle contest entries,
      judging, flight assignment, and all of the details of running a contest.
      This may be new to you, but hundreds of contests are now using Reggie so
      it is likely not the last time you will see it!
      </p>

      <p>
      Reggie is an unusual website, not really up-to-date with modern sites.
      It's not hard to use on a regular computer, but can be a little tricky on
      tablets or phones where you must scroll through long pop-up lists.  If
      you're having trouble on your tablet, try again from a computer.  We
      apologize for the inconvenience!
      </p>

      <p>
      Here's the process:
      <ol>

        <li>Go to the Reggie entry screen for the competition at <a
        href="http://reggiebeer.com/ReggieEntry.php?CompetitionID=ZEUFQP1000173">http://reggiebeer.com/ReggieEntry.php?CompetitionID=ZEUFQP1000173</a>.</li>

        <li>If you already have an account in Reggie (i.e., you've entered a
            competition hosted by Reggie before), just log in.  If not, click
        on Create Account, fill in the info, and click "Create".  Include your
        homebrew club if it is listed, or choose "Unlisted" if you can't find
        your club.</li>

        <li>Once logged in to Reggie, click on "Entries".  Then click on "Add An Entry".</li>

        <li>Pick the beer style.  Depending on the style you choose, some
        options may become available, for example to specify a fruit additive.
        Several optoinal fields are available, too -- you can upload your
        recipe, give the name of the beer, and name your co-brewers.  Once
        you've filled in the details for the entry, click "Save New Entry".
        Repeat for any additional entries.</li>

        <li>Select where you will be dropping off your entry.  We have a lot of
        drop-off locations, and their full addresses are listed on the <a
        href="http://kbotb.org/entry_details.html">entry details</a> page for
        your convenience.</li>

        <li>When you have everything finished, check the boxes for the new
        entries and click "Print Bottle Labels" and print out the resulting
        PDF.  This has labels for each bottle that you can cut out and
        rubber-band to the bottles.</li>

        <li>Finally, unless you intend to include a check with your entries,
        use the PayPal form at the bottom of the page to pay for your
        entry.</li>

      </ol>
      </p>

      <p>If you have any questions about the entry process, please contact the
      <a href="email:djmitche@gmail.com">contest organizer</a> at
      djmitche@gmail.com.</p>
