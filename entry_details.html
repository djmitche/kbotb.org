                All categories, including mead and cider, are accepted.
                Note that the categories are from <a href="http://www.bjcp.org/docs/2015_Guidelines_Beer.pdf">2015 BJCP guidelines</a>.
                Page 85 of the style guidelines has a handy translation from 2008 to 2015 styles.

                <h3>What to Enter</h3>
                <p>For each entry, the brewer must submit:

                <ul>
                    <li>Two (2) bottles or one pressurized soda bottle with "carbonator". Bottles may be of any style, but must contain at least 10 ounces and be free of labels and have any identifying marks blacked out. Containers with carbonators must contain at least 24 ounces. Carbonators will be returned to entrants.</li>

                    <li>Bottle identification forms attached to each bottle with a rubber band (no glue or tape).</li>
                    <li>The appropriate entry fee (check) based on the total number of entries unless it has already been paid online.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>For your entry to do best, be sure to supply all of the required information and as much optional information as is appropriate for the style. Refer to the <b>2015</b> BJCP Style Guidelines for the styles that require or may benefit from additional information and for the specific information required. Failure to supply required information such as Classic Style, Special Ingredients, or Carbonation Level (mead, cider) will negatively impact the scoring of your entry. For any questions about the entry form, the style guidelines, classifying an entry, or supplying additional information, please contact the Competition Registrar.

                <p>Bottles will not be returned.

                <h4>Packing and Shipping</h4>

                <p>Carefully pack your entries in a sturdy box. Line the inside of your carton with a plastic trash bag. Partition and pack each bottle with adequate packaging material. Do not over pack! Write clearly: "Fragile. This Side Up." on the package. Your package should weigh less than 25 pounds. Please refrain from using "messy" packaging materials such a Styrofoam "peanuts" or pellets; please use packaging material such as bubble wrap.

                <p>Enclose each of of your bottle labels in a small zip-top bag before attaching to their respective bottles with a rubber band. This makes it possible for the organizer to identify specifically which beer has broken if there is damage during shipment.  The labels must be removed before judging, so do not tape or glue to the bottle.

                <p>Every reasonable effort will be made to contact entrants whose bottles have broken to make arrangements for sending replacement bottles.

                <p>It is not against any Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) regulations or federal laws to ship your entries via privately owned shipping company for analytical purposes. However, IT IS ILLEGAL TO SHIP ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES VIA THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE. Private shipping companies have the right to refuse your shipment if they are informed that the package contains glass and/or alcoholic beverages. Be aware that entries mailed internationally are often required by customs to have proper documentation. These entries might be opened and/or returned to the shipper by customs' officials at their discretion. It is solely the entrant's responsibility to follow all applicable laws and regulations.

                <p>Mail your entry to

                <address>
                    The C. H. Evans Brewing company at<br/>
                    The Albany Pump Station<br/>
                    19 Quackenbush Square, Albany, NY 12207
                </address>

                <p><b>Judges</b> may bring their entries with them the day of the contest.  Please arrive on-time (9am) if you are bringing your own entries, as we need time to process them!</p>

                <h3>Drop-Off Locations</h3>

                Drop off your fully-labeled bottles at any of these locations.
                Note that locations may appreciate it if you bring along an empty case that can hold your entries along with other entrants' bottles.
