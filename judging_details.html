                <h3>Qualifications</h3>
                <p><b>Steward:</b>
                Stewards are responsible for keeping the judges supplied with the supplies they need (especially beer) throughout the contest, and for problem-solving any issues that come up.
                Stewards will begin the day by helping to organize the materials, and once the judging begins will be assigned a to serve a single table of judges.
                No special skills are required to be a steward.
                Just be on site and ready to pitch in with whatever needs doing.
                
                <p><b>Judge:</b>
                Judges are responsible for evaluating a series of entries according to BJCP guidelines.
                We welcome inexperienced or even first-time judges, who will be partnered with more experienced judges to ensure a fair evaluation of all entries.
                Judges should be familiar with the 2015 BCJP guidelines and the process of evaluating beer.
                Please contact the judge coordinator (listed above) with any questions about your qualifications.
